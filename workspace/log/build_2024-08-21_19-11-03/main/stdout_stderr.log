[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbasic_navigation2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "basic_navigation2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "basic_navigation2"
  with any of the following names:

    basic_navigation2Config.cmake
    basic_navigation2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "basic_navigation2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "basic_navigation2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "basic_navigation2" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
